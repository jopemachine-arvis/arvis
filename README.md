## ðŸ’¬ What is Arvis? why it is needed?

`Arvis` aims to help you run any scripts or binaries very simply.

I've thought many useful alfred-workflows can run in "cross-platform"; that's why I started to work on this.

`Arvis` also aims to provide "libraries" to help create such `workflow` and `plugins` more easily.

`Arvis` is intentionally built similar to Alfred, but there could be some different points.
